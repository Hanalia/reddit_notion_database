An auto-updated notion datatable built with reddit api, notion api and github actions  
**See Demo** : https://wooden-hortensia-2e9.notion.site/Reddit-Collections-7f1b12c4517a4d2eb4157a8db89d74aa  
**Database URL** : https://wooden-hortensia-2e9.notion.site/f93f03ce6289490c9fd819000d888cf3?v=ec3daf44b6fb4a73b9fdaed9e704be63

- Scrape top 10 monthly submissions from subreddits  
 PRAW, a reddit api wrapper for python for scraping  
 Data includes title, url, score, created date, subreddit  

- Update the submission info as rows at a pre-defined notion datatable   
 Before updating, retrieve url data from the notion datatable and create a hashmap to use for searching (in order to prevent entry of duplicates)

- Schedule the above tasks (1 ~ 3) so that it is performed automatically, every day.

Duplicate both notion templates 
  a) page template https://www.notion.so/Reddit-Collections-7f1b12c4517a4d2eb4157a8db89d74aa
  b) database template https://www.notion.so/f93f03ce6289490c9fd819000d888cf3?v=ec3daf44b6fb4a73b9fdaed9e704be63

### Setting your secrets
Set the repository secrets for the below :
You can follow this [link](https://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/github_actions_11_secrets.html) for instructions

4. Customize your own subreddits and enjoy!


## Comments
1. If you add any blocks or text before the 'Subreddits to Scrape' block, the notion api will not be able to fetch subreddit information.
2. When adding new subreddits, please 'shift+enter' and add so that all the subreddits are inside a single block. 
The 'newly-Added' is in a single block with the previous text.

However the below 'newly-Added' is in a separate block with the previous text.

 - Currently the code fetchs data from a specific block at a specific point from the page, so any changes in block location will break the code.

3. Currently the notion api does not support uploading of files/images. So for image-dense submissions (eg. dataisbeautiful), unfortunately I couldn't directly upload the images to the database. This feature can be updated in the future along with updates from the notion api.
